{{< faq "Extremely knowledgeable about website development" >}}
 I have been assisting Julia in the development of a [website](https://Youth4Climate350.org) for the Youth4Climate program. Given my limited background in web design, I appreciate what an excellent mentor Julia has been to me. She is extremely knowledgeable about website development, including the use of WordPress and the elements of good web design. She is very professional, responds to my questions and requests in a timely manner, and is a pleasure to work with. Our organization is lucky to have someone with her expertise working with us.

{{< faq "Way above expectations" >}}
I had a great experience working with Julia on my [website](https://vilga.com/). Way above expectations. She was very generous with her time and went above and beyond to accommodate changes. She offered her own suggestions and educated me on best practices. Julia clearly has experience working on similar projects which was on display in every step of the process. Even though she lives on the opposite coast, the communication was always very timely. She conducted a training session which enabled me to make basic changes to the site on my own. I highly recommend Julia!

{{< faq "A wealth of talent, creativity and knowledge" >}}
From the get go Ms. Borodanenko was a pleasure to work with and possessed a wealth of talent, creativity and knowledge that surpassed that of any other web designer we had worked with before. Ms. Borodaenko was able to take our rough ideas and turn them into something polished and professional [our website](https://surfcatcafe.org/). Not only did she improve our page's "looK', but she also made it much more easily navigated--very user friendly. Add to this the fact that Ms. Borodaenko not only gave us the web page of our dreams, but she also trained us in the skills necessary to make some of the small changes in detail that need to be done from time to time. She helped us to become stewards of our web site.

{{< faq "A strong work ethic" >}}
Julia has been a wonderful web developer throughout the entire project. She has built a [website](https://longviewschool.org/) for my school which is user-friendly (both desktop and mobile) and has received wonderful feedback from our current families. Julia quickly understood our vision of the website and started to work on it immediately. Throughout the process, it was easy to communicate with Julia via email. Her communication was always clear. She has a strong work ethic and was helping us throughout the whole process. We are more than delighted with the end result and Julia even taught us how to work the website through the backend so we can make minor modifications if we need to. Longview School highly recommends Julia as a web developer!

{{< faq "Amazing website from scratch" >}}
I highly recommend Julia Borodaenko! She created my amazing [website](https://zartfun.com/)  from scratch, provided on going support, and changed the site according to the growing needs. The site looks very professional and artistic at the same time! I received a lot of compliments from fellow artists, customers, and friends. Julia is very knowledgeable, professional, and hard working person. On top of all that she is incredibly great person to work with: nice, kind, and creative! I’m lucky I have had a chance working with Julia. I can’t thank her enough for everything she did for me and my business! Highly recommend Julia and her services!

{{< faq "She is prompt and purposeful" >}}
Julia always goes above and beyond with her work. She is prompt and purposeful while developing our [website](https://growmyfuture.org/). If she does not know something she will figure it out faster than you have time to google search or offer support. It is rare to meet such a capable self starter. We had to change things a number of times and not once was there a compliant. Instead Julia jumped into the new challenge of redesign with grace and a get it done attitude. It has been a true pleasure working with Julia. I highly highly recommend her.

{{< faq "Came up with a solution quickly" >}}
Julia was a pleasure to work with. She helped Friends of Bolton Mansion redesign and redevelop our [website](https://boltonmansion.org/). She made herself available even when she was traveling out of the country. She came up with a solution quickly after receiving our requirements and gave her recommendations if she felt what we were asking for could be more user friendly. We would definitely recommend and work with Julia again!

{{< faq "Website is easy to navigate" >}}
 Amazing work! Julia reworked our small, stagnant site into a [fresh design](https://instepwithhorses.org/) that is easy to navigate and allows visitors to quickly find information on our services and events. She completely rebuilt it from the ground up! And Julia is a pleasure to work with; she responds quickly to our needs and makes changes in a flash. 100% endorse her work!
